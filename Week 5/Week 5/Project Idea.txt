W05 Project Idea: A Shoping Cart

Description of Project 

I will built a shoping cart. The shopping cart application is a application that allows users 
to add products to a virtual cart, view the contents of the cart and calculate the total price 
of the products. The application will use objects to represent products, modules to store and 
manipulate the products in the cart, and array functions to manipulate the contents of the cart 
and display relevant information to users.

Addressing Project Requirement

In this application, for example, a "Product" object can be defined to represent an individual product, 
with attributes such as the name, price and others fields. Then, a "Shopping Cart" module can be used to 
store and manipulate the products in the cart. This module can include functions such as "addProduct" 
to add a product to the cart and "getTotal" to calculate the total price of the products in the cart.

In addition, array functions can be used to manipulate the contents of the cart, such as "reduce" 
to calculate the total price of the products in the cart. Functions such as "map" and "filter" can also 
be used to manipulate the products in the cart and display relevant information to users.

In summary, the shopping cart application can be implemented using objects to represent the products, 
modules to store and manipulate the products in the cart and array functions to manipulate the contents 
of the cart and display relevant information to users.
