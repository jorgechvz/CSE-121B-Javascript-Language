Task Week 7: What Next?

Assessing Online Sources

What, do you think, made the difference between a good source and one that
wasn't so good? 

In my thoughts the difference between a good source and one that is not so good
is often based on the accuracy, reliability and completeness of the information
provided. A good source should have up-to-date and accurate information, be
transparent about its sources, and offer clear, well organized content.

Have you learned to tell reputable sources from iffy ones?  How have you begun to
differentiate between reputable and iffy sources?

I have learned that to see if a source is reputable and one that is not. I look
for authors or organizations that have a respected reputation in the field I'm
looking for, I also see on their website their legitimate domain that is relevant
to the content I'm looking for. For example for JavaScript, I see domains that
include JavaScript or web development.
I also see that the information in the source is updated and that it has been
reviewed. I also consult with other sources to corroborate the information
provided and cross-reference the information in order to guarantee the veracity
of the information. I also see that the information is properly ordered and
relevant.

If, for example, you were going to answer someone's coding question about this
language, what should you do to be a reputable source?

I would ensure that my answer is based on accurate and up to date information,
and provide references to credible sources to support my answer. It's also
important to be clear and concise in my explanation, and to provide working
examples or code snippets whenever possible.

What online sources have you used and in what order would you rank them for
quality and usability?

1. Mozilla Developer Network (MDN). It is one of the most reliable and
comprehensive sources for JavaScript documentation. MDN provides a detailed
reference guide for all language features and functions, and is regularly updated
to reflect the latest updates and changes. The code examples are clear and
helpful, and the documentation is presented in an easy to understand format for
beginners and experienced programmers alike.

2. W3Schools. It is an educational website that covers many programming topics,
including JavaScript. W3Schools offers a wealth of tutorials and code samples, as
well as an online practice to help developers apply what they've learned. The
code examples are clear and well explained, and the web page structure is easy to
navigate.

3. DevDocs. The DevDocs platform offers a complete and up to date collection of
official JavaScript documentation, including the ECMAScript specification, as
well as documentation for popular libraries and frameworks such as React,
Angular, Vue, and jQuery. For this reason, DevDocs is a good source for
JavaScript documentation, as it offers a wide range of up to date information, an
easy to use interface, and useful features that allow developers to quickly find
the JavaScript information they need.

4. Javascript.info. JavaScript.info is a good source of information on JavaScript
due to its comprehensive focus on learning the language, its clean and
easy to use user interface, and its wealth of practical examples and exercises.

a trusted source for developers looking to improve their JavaScript skills.

5. Stack Overflow. It is a question and answer platform that offers a large
number of solutions and resources for specific JavaScript problems. Community
members often provide quick and helpful answers, and the answers with the most
votes are often the most helpful and accurate. Stack Overflow is a useful tool
for any programmer looking for solutions to specific problems in their code.
